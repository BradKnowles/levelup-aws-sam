# Level Up with AWS SAM: The Ultimate Serverless Toolkit

## Abstract

Join me on the journey of introducing the AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) toolkit into your serverless development workflow. We'll take a C# .NET API from File...New Project to a fully deployed AWS application using Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda, and Amazon DynamoDB. While it may seem like magic, we'll dig into the details to demystify that magic so you walk away with a full understanding of the process. No application development journey is complete without testing. AWS SAM has you covered here as well. We'll explore SAM's secret weapon to aid in keeping that dev-test-deploy feedback loop as tight as possible.
